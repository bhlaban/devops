UseExistingEmptyDatabase=False

; Determines whether a configuration database will get created
CreateConfigurationDatabase=True

; Database label controls the names of the configuration databases.  Database name will be Tfs_<label>Configuration, Tfs_<label>Warehouse and Tfs_<label>Analysis
DatabaseLabel=

StartTrial=True

; Boolean to determine whether the account is a built-in account
IsServiceAccountBuiltIn=True

; Account that the TFS web site will run as.  On a domain joined machine, this can be a domain account or NT Authority\Network Service.  On a workgroup machine, it can be a local account or NT Authority\Local Service

; SiteBindings is a semi-colon separated list of bindings, each of which consists
; of 4 or 6 parts (4 for http, 6 for https):
; 
; [http|https]:[ipaddress]:[port]:[host]:[certificateStore]:[certificateThumprint|"generate"]
; 
; Examples:
; http:*:8080:
; 
; A single http binding on port 8080, for all unassigned IP addresses, with no host header
; 
; https:*:443:contoso.com:My:generate
; 
; A single https binding on port 443, for all unassigned IP addresses, having a host header 'contoso.com',
; including a generated self-signed certificate that will be stored in the Personal store
; on the local machine.
; 
; http:*:8080:;http:*:8082:
; 
; Two bindings separated by a semi-colon
; 
; https:*:443:contoso.com:My:â€Ž169CE0BCCECBD854321A61670413F8000A798F31
; 
; A single https binding on port 443 with a certificate thumbprint.

; machine.
